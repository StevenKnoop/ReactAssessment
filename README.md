# ReactAssessment

In 3 days I was able create a basic React project and a nodeJS server.

What was I able to complete:
- Integrate with MongoDB.
- Pull test data from IMBD.
- Load data from a json file if the IMBD api failed (free limit reached).
- Display the TV Shows in a clean look, simular to Netflix.
- Created a DB diagram.
- Added a Login page.
- Added API routes to insert and fetch data from MongoDB.
